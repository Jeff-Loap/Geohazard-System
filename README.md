# Geohazard-System
About me:
Hi I am He Yulin. I'm a senior in the USM School of Computer Science, I major in software engineering and minor in mathematics.
My FYP: Geohazard System
Subsystems 1: Geohazard simulation with DEM in GIS
Subsystems 2: Geohazard data crawler
Subsystems 3: Geohazard visualization
My subsystems: Geohazard simulation with DEM in GIS:
Develop a 3D model using Data Elevation Model (DEM) for flood or landslide with QGIS.
QGIS functions as geographic information system (GIS) software, allowing users to analyse and edit spatial information. Geohazard data can be feed to the system in real time and store it to the databases. The QGIS can import the data and render the images and reproduce the new 3D map. The system should be able to let users visualize the geohazards happening in the specified areas. It also allows the content developer able to add historical events and simulate potential hazards that may happen with certain new climate data such as heavy raining or storm. This kind of system is very useful for geohazard management to create awareness and mitigate losses.
